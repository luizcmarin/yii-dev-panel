## Installation

```shell
npm install
```

## Usage

The application use HTTP API to work with the modules.

There are a few ways to use the Yii Dev Panel:

### Asset / Standalone application

To use the application you need to build the app and specify the URL your app running on.
Connect the apps and serve the built app any way you want: nginx, apache, node, php built-in server.

### PWA

Online-mode or as standalone application.

Open https://yiisoft.github.io/yii-dev-panel

1. Online-mode
    1. There is an app. Specify the PHP app URL and use Yii dev panel.
2. Standalone app
    1. Click "Install" button in the URL to install PWA application
    2. Run the application from the Applications
    3. Make sure your API works by clicking on "check mark"
    4. Use Yii dev panel

Both options also work with mobile phones.

## Architecture

The project follows monorepository patterns. The project consists of several packages:

### `@yii-dev-panel/sdk`

The SDK package. It is used to simplify creating applications or custom panels.

### `@yii-dev-panel/toolbar` - the toolbar application

The `toolbar` application. It is used to display the toolbar on the page.

The package is used to display the toolbar on the page. It can be used separately from the `app` application.

Add the following code to the page to display the toolbar:

```html
<div id="yii-dev-toolbar" style="flex: 1"></div>
<script src="https://yiisoft.github.io/yii-dev-panel/toolbar/bundle.js"></script>
<script src="https://yiisoft.github.io/yii-dev-panel/toolbar/bundle.css"></script>
```

The `toolbar` application requires only `sdk` package.

### `@yii-dev-panel/app`

The main application.

The `app` application requires both `sdk` and `toolbar` packages.
