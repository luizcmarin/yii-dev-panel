# Yii Development Panel

### About

Yii Development Panel â€“ it is an application that aggregates such different modules as:

- Debug
- Inspector
- Gii (not ready to use yet)

> **Note:** this project is like a Proof of Concept and not officially supported by @yiisoft organization 
> even if I am a core developer.
> 
> Someday it would be moved to `yiisoft` organization if it has satisfied the following requirements:
> 1. It's easy to create custom panels at least for Debug module.
> 2. It's unnecessary to download and build JS packages with NPM or any other tools.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

> **Note:** `legacy-peer-deps` flag is required because `react-json-view` does not support React 18.
