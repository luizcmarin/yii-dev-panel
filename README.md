# Yii Development Panel

### About

Yii Development Panel â€“ it is an application that aggregates such different modules as:

- Debug
- Inspector
- Gii

> **Note:** this project is like a Proof of Concept and not officially supported by @yiisoft organization 
> even if I am a core developer.
> 
> Someday it would be moved to `yiisoft` organization if it has satisfied the following requirements:
> 1. It's easy to create custom panels at least for Debug module.
> 2. It's unnecessary to download and build JS packages with NPM or any other tools.

## Installation

The application use HTTP API to work with modules. 
To use the application you need to have the built app and working API.
Unfortunately, browsers prohibit working with `localhost` from the Internet by security reasons.

3. Run the application from the Applications
4. Make sure your API works by clicking on "check mark"
